          The Australian Dollar (AUD) is the currency of Australia. One euro
          corresponds to approx. 1.55 AUD (as of 03.01.2022). The money can be
          exchanged in banks or exchange offices. For security reasons, we
          advise against exchanging money with private individuals. Credit card
          payments are widely used in Australia.

          Unfazed by traditions, Australians don't mind combining their native
          bush food, seafood and meat like crocodile, kangaroo and emu with the
          spices of their Asian neighbors. They like to cook a roast lamb at
          Easter, fresh prawns at Christmas and enjoy juicy mangos in the
          summer. Australians also prefer to eat outdoors as much as possible;
          breakfast in a street caf√©, toasting the sunset with a glass of
          sparkling wine and a plate of oysters on a roof terrace or meeting
          friends for a barbecue in the garden.

          Although Australia does not legally have an official language and
          English is not the country's official language, it is spoken almost
          everywhere. Indigenous peoples, such as the Australian Aborigines,
          speak Australian languages, which are divided into a variety of
          language families and groups. Despite such a large number, the total
          number of their speakers is small - no more than 56.000 people. In
          Australia, the languages of the immigrant groups are also spoken,
          primarily Chinese, Italian and Greek.
